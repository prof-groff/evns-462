Province: the province or state that the wine is from</br>
Region 1: the wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)</br>
Region 2: sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank</br>
Winery: the winery that made the wine</br>
Designation: the vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from</br>
Price: the cost for a bottle of the wine</br>

Name: shoshoni.csv</br>
Title: Width-to-Length Ratio of Shoshoni Handicraft</br>
Source: Dubois, Cora (ed.) (1960). Lowie's Selected Papers in Anthropology. University of California Press, Berkeley.</br>
Description: The data are width-to-length ratios of beaded rectangles used by the Shoshoni Indians of America to decorate their leather goods. One might ask whether the golden rectangle (for which the width-to-length ratio is 0.618) can be considered an aesthetic standard for the Shoshonis just as it was for the Greeks and the Egyptians.</br>
Tests: One-sample t-test against a true mean of 0.618</br>

Name: beerbottle.csv</br>
Title: Measurement of Beer Head Retention</br>
Source: R.G. Ault, E.J. Hudson, D.J. Linehan, and J.D. Woodward (1967).</br>
"A Practical Approach to the Assessment of Head Retention of Bottled Beers,"
Journal of the Institute of Brewing, Vol. 73, Issue 6, pp. 558-566.</br>
Description: Three aspects of head retention are calculated for 3 bottlings, (n1=n2=20,n3=19):
Head Formation, %Adhesion, and %Collapse Rate of foam.</br>
Readings made:</br>
A = @ 5secons: Top of beer foam</br>
B = @ 30seconds: level of the residual of beer below zero mark</br>
C = @ 240seconds: top of beer foam</br>
D = level of the center of the foam</br>
E = level of the residual beer</br>
%Adhesion = 100((A+B)-(A-C))/(A+B)</br>
%Collapse = 100((A+B)-(D+E))/(A+B)</br>
Tests: One-way ANOVA, independent samples t-test</br>

A = monthly mean thickness in January</br>
B = monthly mean thickness in February</br>
The data are paired by year for a random sample of 15 years.</br>
Tests: Paired t-test</br>
